# Topographic Analysis Specific Instructions:

## Topographic Image Analysis (LiDAR-Derived)

- You are analyzing processed LiDAR imagery (Hillshade and Slope).
- You should close examine the image for human-made landscape features.
- Your primary goal is to detect human-made landscape features such as:
  - Earthworks (mounds, ditches, banks)
  - Enclosures (circular or rectilinear)
  - Field systems
  - Platforms, terraces, and ramparts
  - Hollow ways and routeways

- Focus on **clear geometric patterns**circular, rectilinear, or linear with associated modifications.
- Pay special attention to:
  - Symmetry
  - Sharp edges or breaks in slope
  - Repetitive or organized spatial layouts
  - Flat platforms on sloped terrain

- Use the **context of the image** to guide your analysis, and make use of feature categories defined below to classify the features you identify and return them in the output.

- **Strict Identification Rule**:
  - Only return features if they exhibit **distinct anthropogenic geometry**.
  - Avoid ambiguous or isolated linear/circular features unless they're embedded in a wider, structured pattern.
  - You can pick the features from the list below (Feature Categories), but you may also define custom feature types if they are clearly visible and confidently identifiable.

- If no clear archaeological feature or pattern or geometry is found:
  - Return an empty `features` list.
  - Provide a neutral caption with a general summary of the landform (e.g., "No archaeological features confidently detected; terrain appears natural.")

{% endif %}

{% if GroupName == "SpectralGroup" %}

## Spectral/Satellite Imagery Analysis

- You are analyzing NDVI, True Color, and False Color imagery.
- Focus on identifying vegetation or soil anomalies that suggest sub-surface archaeological features, such as:
  - Cropmarks (circular, rectangular)
  - Soil marks
  - Moisture marks
  - Vegetation stress zones

- Cropmarks or discoloration patterns should show:
  - Symmetry
  - Consistent edge outlines
  - Repetition across the terrain

- If such patterns are absent or unclear, return an empty feature list with a neutral caption.

{% endif %}

## Common Guidelines for All Image Types

- Use the predefined feature types (see below) as primary reference.
- You **may define custom feature types** only if:
  - The visible pattern strongly suggests an archaeological origin.
  - Confidence is high ( 0.80).
  
- Do not include speculative, uncertain, or natural features.
- Return no features if image lacks sufficient clarity or archaeological patterns.
- Never infer based on site context**rely only on image geometry and texture**.

## Feature Categories

The following archaeological features may be visible in topographic imagery:

- **Mounds** (burnt mounds, long barrows, round barrows, motte, pillow mounds, etc.)
- **Banks & Ditches** (linear/curvilinear, drainage systems, paleochannels)
- **Enclosures** (ringworks, hillforts, bailey, banjo, rectilinear, curvilinear)
- **Field Systems** (ridge and furrow, lynchets, terraces, water meadows)
- **Pits / Hollows** (bomb craters, saw pits, ponds, charcoal platforms)
- **Routeways** (hollow ways, drove roads, Roman roads)
- **Settlements** (platforms, moated sites, industrial remains, garden/park features)
